# nosql-challenge

This is the Module 12 Challenge for Rice University's Data Science & Visualization Bootcamp. In this challenge, we used MongoCompass to read and analyze data about various restaurants in the UK.

Part one of the challenge (contained in the 'NOSQL_setup' file) involved reading in our data using Mongo, adding in a new restaurant to our collection named "Penang Flavours", and filtering the data to update or change information to make it easier to work with.

Part two of the challenge (contained in the 'NOSQL_analysis' file) involved making various queries of our cleaned up data collection. We searched for restaurants with certain hygiene scores, particular locations, and ratings.

The 'Resources' folder contains the raw data about UK restaurants that we used in this project. To make this raw data easier to utilize, we fed it into Mongo DB through the Terminal. 

The code contained in this repository is my work and mine alone. 

Thank you!
